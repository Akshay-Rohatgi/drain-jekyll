**Project Idea**
Create an application for teachers to upload grades and run analytics on them. Allow for easy implementation of curves and scales. Many teachers express frustration with synergy and we're going to take on the challenge to help with those frustrations. 
<br>
We're going to approach the development of the application holistically. Each of us will develop certain parts of the application and then eventually combine them to create a robust, interconnected system.
