**Notes from crossover meeting ([review-ticket](https://github.com/ArnavPalkhiwala/APCSATri3/issues/7)):**
- Wireframe is done well, shows actual progress on ideas presented
- Website actions properly documented with real use case examples
- Authentication and admin/user system being explored, a group we can collaborate with on similar ideas.
- Deployment plan is robust and real commands/tangibles shown with plan
